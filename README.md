# Kelpie - Teaching kids the benefits of unplugging

## Challenge

*Challenge 3: How might we bring the Unplug to Connect campaign into homes / workplaces and engage the whole family / corporate partners / public?.*

## Background  

The Boys and Girls Clubs of Canadaâ€™s Unplug to Connect campaign encourages all Canadians to spend more time with friends, family, and co-workers, and less time in front of their screens.
